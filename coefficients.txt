I don't have this rigorously done yet, but I plan to make a table with the
following results:

Dataset,Most Informative Feature,Percent of Runs In Which It Was Most Informative
ALP,K-S Statistic,70%
ALB,Count of ALB in LabChemTestName,60%
etc

where this table shows, for each dataset, the feature most frequently chosen
(in 10-fold cross validation) as the most informative feature, and the percent
of runs in which it was chosen as most informative.

Based on previous results that I remember, the K-S statistic is very often
chosen as the most informative feature.
